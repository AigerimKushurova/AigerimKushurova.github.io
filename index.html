I learnt the importance of the digital and media literacy, and improved my skill of time management and working under pressure.<br>
        There were 10 IB Learner Profiles: Inquirers, Knowledgeable, Thinkers, Communicators, Principled, Open-minded, Caring, Risk-takers, Balanced, Reflective. And thus I believe I have gained these features throughout my learning</p>
